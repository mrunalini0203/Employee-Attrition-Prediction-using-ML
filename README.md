# Employee-Attrition-Prediction-using-ML
To develop a machine learning model that predicts employee attrition, enabling organizations to identify at-risk employees and implement strategies to improve retention.
Employee attrition is a critical concern for businesses, as it leads to increased costs in hiring, training, and reduced
productivity. This project aims to predict employee attrition using machine learning techniques by analyzing
historical employee data. By identifying patterns and factors contributing to attrition, organizations can take
proactive measures to retain talent.

Project Details:
Objective: To develop a predictive model that helps organizations identify employees at risk of leaving, enabling proactive retention strategies.
Tools & Techniques: Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, and XG Boost for predictive modeling; Seaborn and Matplotlib for data visualization.
Process Overview:
Explored and cleaned the dataset to identify patterns and correlations.
Engineered key features like work environment satisfaction, job role, and salary hike history.
Built and tuned classification models, achieving an accuracy of 85 %.
Delivered actionable insights, such as , "Work-life balance was the most critical factor".
Key Outcomes:
Improved understanding of attrition trends within organizations.
Practical strategies for HR teams to reduce turnover rates and retain top talent.
